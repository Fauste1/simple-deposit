A practice project regarding sending ETH and other tokens on-chain.

Might add some more functionality in the future, such as:
- savings rate = a token drip based on how long you had your ETH deposited
- variable savings rate based on an on-chain oracle
- multiple choices of savings pools
- integration with simple exchange contract
